##System requirements

You need an actual Java 7 installation on your computer to run this application.
To build the application you need an installation of Maven 3. 

##Technologies

This software was programmed in Java with its UI-Technology JavaFX2.2. To build the application Maven was used. For testing purposes I used JUnit. 

##Design of the application

###User Interface

For the user interface of the application the new standard UI-technology JavaFX2.2 was used. I decided to use a flat design according to the actual design trend for user interfaces. With its simple and clear structure the user gets all the information on one place. 
The blue color scheme for the application stands in a correlation with the name of the application. 
All objects with round corners charaterizes objects the user could interact with.
