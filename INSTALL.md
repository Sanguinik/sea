#INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

1. Install an actual version of Java 7 Oracle JDK and Maven 3.
2. You must put the JavaFX runtime on the classpath of your development machine. The easiest way to do this is to run the following command (from anywhere, does not need a POM):

	`mvn com.zenjava:javafx-maven-plugin:1.5:fix-classpath`

	(You will eventually need sudo permissions on a linux machine.)

3.
